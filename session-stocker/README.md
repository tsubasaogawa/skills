# session-stocker-skill

This skill extracts reusable knowledge from the current conversation and saves it as a Markdown note in an artifacts folder.

## Overview

This skill turns an in-progress session into something you can revisit later. Instead of preserving a chat transcript, it focuses on concise, reusable information such as conclusions, decision factors, caveats, and references.

The output directory is configured through `config.toml`.

In this repository, the skill reads `artifacts.directory` from the root `config.toml`.
If it is not set, the following default path is used:

`/mnt/c/Users/t_ogawa/Documents/documents/12_Artifacts/`

```toml
[artifacts]
directory = "/path/to/your/artifacts"
```

## When to use it

Use this skill when you want to preserve the contents of a conversation for later reference, especially when you want the result saved to disk as a Markdown file.

Typical triggers:

- `このセッションをストックして`
- `この会話を残して`
- `今回の内容を artifacts に保存して`
- `セッションの知見をメモ化して`

## Generated file

The generated file uses the following format:

`<artifacts-directory>/<YYYYMMDD>_<session-summary>.md`

Here, `<artifacts-directory>` is `artifacts.directory` from `config.toml`.

### Filename rules

- Prefix the filename with the current date in `YYYYMMDD` format
- Use a short summary of the conversation in the filename
- Replace spaces with `-`
- Remove or replace unsafe filename characters such as `/`, `\\`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, and `|`
- Keep the sanitized filename readable

If a file with the same name already exists, do not overwrite it. Append `-2`, `-3`, and so on instead.

### How to choose the summary name

The summary should be short, specific, and understandable without reading the full conversation.

Examples:

- `Terraform module 分割方針`
- `Python 集計スクリプト改善`
- `GitHub Actions 失敗原因調査`

## Markdown output format

The saved Markdown must include the following sections in this order:

```md
# <session-summary>

## 概要

## 知見

## 参考情報
```

### Purpose of each section

#### `概要`

Summarize what the session accomplished in a short, outcome-oriented way.

#### `知見`

Record learnings and decisions that will be useful later. Use bullet points when there are multiple items.

Include:

- conclusions that were reached
- important assumptions or constraints
- patterns worth reusing
- pitfalls or caveats discovered during the session

#### `参考情報`

Record concrete references that may be useful later.

Examples:

- file paths
- command names
- tool names
- issue or PR numbers
- URLs referenced during the work

If there are no relevant items, write `- なし` instead of leaving the section empty.

## Execution flow

This skill follows the steps below:

1. Review the current conversation and extract information with lasting value
2. Decide on a short summary for the session
3. Read `config.toml` and resolve `artifacts.directory`
4. Ensure the resolved output directory exists
5. Build the Markdown content in the required format
6. Save the file using the required naming rule
7. Tell the user the saved path and briefly summarize what was captured

## Quality bar

Before saving, make sure at least the following are true:

- the file is actually written to disk
- the filename follows the required pattern
- the content is concise and useful when revisited later
- the `知見` section contains practical takeaways rather than a transcript rewrite
- the `参考情報` section contains concrete references or `- なし`

## Why this skill is useful

This skill turns an ephemeral chat into a reusable artifact. By preserving investigation results, decisions, and implementation notes as artifacts, it becomes much easier to revisit the same topic later.
